<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Charan Nalagatla, and I’m passionate about all things tech—especially software development, web development, and game development. 
  I enjoy turning ideas into functional, user-friendly digital experiences. 
  Whether it’s coding the backend of a system, designing a responsive website,
  or exploring the mechanics of game engines, I’m always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow as a developer.</p>
<p>
  In my free time, I like to unwind by playing online games on my PC and listening to music, which helps me stay relaxed and inspired. 
  I’m currently building this portfolio to showcase some of the projects I’ve worked on, highlight the skills I’ve developed, and connect with others who share my enthusiasm for technology and creativity. 
  I'm excited about where this journey will take me and always open to learning and collaboration.
